A discrete numerical simulation is computed several times with different deviations of the input parameters to produce different outputs of the same model to analyze those effects. The relevant stochastic or parametric output variables, such as mean, expected value, and variance, are often calculated and visualized only at selected individual points of the whole domain. This project aims to provide a simple way to perform stochastic/parametric post-processing of numerical simulations on entire domains using the VTK unstructured grid (VTU) file system and the Julia language as an example.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Install","page":"Home","title":"Install","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"import Pkg\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/baxmittens/XMLParser.jl.git\")\nPkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/baxmittens/VTUFileHandler.jl.git\")","category":"page"},{"location":"#Preliminaries","page":"Home","title":"Preliminaries","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The VTUFileHandler will eventually be used to perform stochastic post-processing on large VTU result files.
